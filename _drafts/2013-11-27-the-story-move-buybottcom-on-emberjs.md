A few months ago, our team wanted to move our front-end code into modern MV* framework. The main reason is that our code becomes messy and hard to maintain. We were thinking to find a better way to **manage** our front-end code. My boss wanted me to do some research on current MV* frameworks. The best resource pop out from the top of my head is [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

During that time, I needed to keep working on the new features and also played with these frameworks. Honestly, I just tried [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Ember](http://emberjs.com/).

The reason I wanted to try Backbone is lots of people talk about this, lots of resource, and it works pretty well with [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/). However, I read some articles talking about Backbone is not a **framework**, just a library and you need to take time to find other resources work with it and this makes me hesitated to use it into buybott, because we don’t have time to resolve all possible problems come from different libraries.

I have heard the Ember.js for a while because of YEHUDA KATZ. He is an awesome guy who contributes lots of open source projects, such as Ruby On Rails, jQuery. So, it is kind of loyalty to follow someone’s opinoin. The time I switch to use Ember.js, only route, didn’t take much time. For me, it is pretty similar Ruby On Rails. This step impressed my boss.
